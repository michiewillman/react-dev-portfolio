      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer passionate about leveraging my experience in
        design and communications to build creative technology people will love
        and appreciate. Creating websites for the benefit of everyday people who
        use them is what motivates me to continuously push myself to learn new
        skills and seek endless growth. I have 10+ years of experience with
        content management, and love sharing my knowledge directly with clients
        in a straight-forward way that even beginners can follow.
